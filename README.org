the path of trucks in real time, give notifications when garbage collection is
due, allow users to give feed backs, etc.

** How to work together (when commiting messages)
1. only make changes on your branch (ex. Even for even-branch, daniel for
   daniel-branch)
2. *DON'T USE* ~git push --force~
3. use ~git rebase~ before pushing anything, make sure it does not conflict with
   commit history
4. always sync with the testing branch!! (~git rebase testing~)
5. include a descriptive title
6. use descriptive message in your commit
7. make sure your commits are small
8. git push origin main
